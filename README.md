Hex editor by Roland Waddilove

Open a file on disk and show it in hexadecimal or decimal views. Edit any byte in the file and save the modified file. It reads/shows 256 bytes at a time, so files can be any size and are not restricted by memory.

It works entirely in text mode and was written as a Python learning exercise, not as a finished app that you would actually use. It reflects what I've learnt so far and there are probably better ways of doing this. Let me know if you find it useful.
